# Make-an-Air-Canvas-with-OpenCV

Imagine you can draw in the air with out using any brush, just wave your hand in the air and you will create many great things 
Air Canvas is what you need to do such beautiful things
using OpenCV library is very intersting to do this project

`Important Changes`:
- I don't like color trackbar so i have don esome adustments to all the code.
- I'm using lower and upper boundaries due to `HSV` color space.
- I'm now using `Color Blue` in order to use any other color just adjust the folloing code with its boundaries 

Note:
- I will provide slides to explain nature and how this air canvas really works soon
